Instructions for Adding a New Book
================================================================================
To add a new book, simply copy one of the book objects below and paste it
as a new element in the `allBooks` array.

Then, update the values for the new book.

Required fields for each book object:
- id: A unique number for this book.
- title: The short title of the book (e.g., "Playing with Fire").
- fullTitle: The complete title used for descriptions.
- description: A paragraph describing the book.
- amazonUrl: The direct link to the book's Amazon page.
- publishDate: The year of publication (e.g., "2024").
- series: The series the book belongs to (e.g., "Dark Academia", "Standalone").
- cover: The imported cover image (import it at the top of this file).
- rating: The book's numerical rating (e.g., 4.5).
- genre: The specific genre of the book. This is used for filtering on the
         Books page. (e.g., "Dark Academia Romance", "Medical Romance").

NOTE on automatically adding books via Amazon link:
The request to add a book simply by pasting an Amazon link is a more complex
feature. It would require a backend service to fetch and parse the data from
Amazon, as doing this directly in the browser is unreliable. The manual
process below is the most straightforward and robust solution for this app.
